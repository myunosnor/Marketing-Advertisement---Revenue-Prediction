Dataset consist of various costs incurred on advertising by different media such as through TV, radio, newspaper, and the sales for a particular product.

By utilising the scikit-learn's LinearRegression( ) we want to calculate the multiple regression coefficient estimates when TV, radio, and newspaper advertising budgets are used to predict sales revenue. Comparison of the coefficient estimates from multiple regression to those from simple linear regression. 

Feature selection ,model fit and the accuracy of the predictions will be evaluated using RÂ² and RMSE.

Lastly, the introduction of interaction (Synergy) parameter in Regression Analysis in order to improve the model performance.
